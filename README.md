# Bates Discord Theme

I tried my hand on a theme for better discord!

To change the highlight color add
```css
:root {
  --rgb-highlight: R, G, B;
}
```

to your custom CSS. Where R, G and B are the values of the RGB code you want to use!

as an example, here's the default neon blue color code:

```css
:root {
  --rgb-highlight: 4, 217, 255;
}
```

You can also change all "negative" buttons with
```css
:root {
  --close-button: HEX-CODE;
}
```

Where HEX-CODE is the color as a hex-code like #FFFFFF
